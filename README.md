# Some table
## _A new react web-app_


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## Features

- Dynamic table with possibility to show and manipulate data
- Checkbox selection, where at least one row will always be checked
- Routing with handling certain props as a parameter
- Deletion of certain or selected set of rows
- Included sorting, filtration and pagination

The table has a basic CSS properties of Ant Design, so the styles of page
remained unchanged.

## Modules

This project uses a list of modules for React:

- [antd](https://ant.design/components/table/) - components of antd are very helpful especially in this project
- [redux, react-redux](https://redux.js.org) - for global state management
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) - to make code easier to read and debug, and also include type interference
- [lodash](https://lodash.com) - it implements deeper comparison that suits states

And of course I used React, because I can't perform it on any other library ðŸ˜ž
